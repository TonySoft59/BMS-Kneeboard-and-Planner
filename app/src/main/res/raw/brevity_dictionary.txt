USA  The United States does not subscribe to the ommision of the term "Cleared to Engage" as identified in this and the pervious ratification draft of APP-7 in 2006. Rationale.  The term "Cleared to Engage" is used for Type 3 terminal attack control.  It grants a "blanket" weapons release clearance to an aircraft of flight attacking a target or targets, which meet the prescribed restrictions by a joint terminal attack controller.  The term "Cleared Hot" (which is in AAP-7(E)) is used for Types 1 and 2 terminal attack controls.  Additionally, the term "Attack Complete" is in APP-7(E) and is the mandatory call from the attack aircraft, to the terminal controller during Type 3 control, indicating completion of ordnance release.  All of these are standard terms in United States joint doctrine and part of the milti-Service brevity codes publication.  This omission leaves a void in weapons release clearance for Type 3 control.  ATP-3.3.2.1 list the term "Cleared to Engage" in its proper use as well.
