An uncut operation of our wing, with around 24 of us. (~2 hours)
During the start up the pilot enters information into the different systems, which are read
from paper data cards.  When the weather is bad they will also need the approach plates, which would
have to be printed.  This app sets out to save paper, organize, and automate ballistic trajectory planning,
among other thing.  Large operations where each role is critical, should still rely on the printed
datacards by the official Weapon Delivery Planner.  This app is more suited to smaller ones, or when
your printer runs out of paper.
